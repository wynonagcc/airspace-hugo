  title: Our Vision
  description: My Grocery Pal is an application that automates and innovates the grocery
    shopping experience by offering store options based on user needs.
  content: "Users provide their personal grocery list, and My Grocery Pal will quickly
    offer store options, enough to tailor any current user demand. These options can
    range from cheapest price, to closest location, or even to the best reviewed local
    stores.\n\n\nThe application will feature the ability to scroll through data about
    each option, allowing users to compare and contrast the pros and cons between
    different options. The data displayed within each option will be concise and filled
    with only enough information to allow for quick and efficient comparisons. Each
    option will contain information such as total price, distance, and reviews. With
    this knowledge at hand, users can freely choose an option that best satisfies
    their demands.\n\n\nUsers will be able to browse through many provided or user-created
    recipes. Any wanted recipes can then be selected, and a grocery list will be created
    seamlessly from the recipe’s ingredient list. Trying and experimenting with new
    recipes can now be done with ease. Through many complementary features like these,
    My Grocery Pal will be the go-to application for any grocery needs.\n\n\nThe importance
    of My Grocery Pal is to allow users to save not only money, but also the most
    valuable resource, their time. Shopping for groceries is an essential, time consuming
    chore for everyone. With \nMy Grocery Pal, the monotonous process of individually
    sifting through advantages and disadvantages of potential grocery choices will
    be automated and streamlined. A feature so desperately needed in our busy lifestyles.\n\n\nThis
    application is intended to be a mobile application with support for iOS and android
    devices. Future releases could support compatibility with MacOs and Windows.\n\n\nThe
    project will be considered a success based on two criteria. First, users will
    be allowed to submit their honest opinion about the application and will be able
    to provide ratings from 1 - 5 on the specifics of the application through an evaluation
    form, with 1 being the lowest rating, and 5 being the highest. Second, users will
    also have an option to give an overall rating on their respective app-store. If
    the average app rating is found to be 4 or greater, or if the average evaluation
    form rating is greater than 4, then the application will be considered a success."
